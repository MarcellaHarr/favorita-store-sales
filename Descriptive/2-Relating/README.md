In the initial phase of the descriptive analysis, the process of establishing connections commenced with a comprehensive exploration of table information.

Queries, such as viewing detailed table information using `pragma table_info` for each pertinent table— `holidays_events`, `oil`, `stores`, `test`, `train`, and `transactions` — played a pivotal role in forming a foundational understanding of the data structure. Subsequently, attention shifted to interconnecting key tables. Noteworthy queries included displaying sample records from the `train`, `transactions`, `stores, oil`, and `holidays_events` tables.

Furthermore, a broader perspective was gained by generating queries to gather counts, sums, and date-related insights across multiple tables. For example, the relationships between store attributes, sales, promotions, and transactional data were thoroughly explored, offering a comprehensive overview of the dataset. 

These preliminary queries set the stage for a meticulous examination of relationships critical to deriving meaningful insights during the descriptive analysis.
